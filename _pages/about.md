# Overview
I am a sophomore in the ITOA program (Information & Tech Oracle Academy) at Havre de Grace High School. My brother introduced me to block coding in Scratch, and my experience making small projects inspired me to join the ITOA program. There, I have demonstrated higher level skill in programming, creating projects and completing assignments quickly. I've been known to help other students complete work as well. Outside of school, I enjoy music, video games, and airsoft. Regarding music, my friends and I occasionally get together to play music, and we hope to eventually form a band. I play bass and have been learning drums. I played cello in school orchestra from 4th to 10th grade, but I quit this year to finish classes necessary for graduation. I picked up airsoft with my dad a few years ago, and we play together every weekend when we can.

# Education
At Havre de Grace, I have taken many programming classes including those for Java and database SQL. I have a great interest in programming and computers, and have held that since middle school. In addition to ITOA classes, I have also taken challenging coursework in the form of AP classes, including AP Government, AP CSB, AP World, and I am currently taking AP CSA and AP Physics 1. My GPA is 4.1875 weighted and 3.5625 unweighted.

# Projects
I've worked on (and continue to edit) a number of projects, listed and linked below.
