# Overview
I am a sophomore in the ITOA program (Information & Tech Oracle Academy) at Havre de Grace High School. My brother introduced me to block coding in Scratch, and my experience making small projects inspired me to join the ITOA program. There, I have demonstrated higher level skill in programming, creating projects and completeing assignments quickly. I've been known to help other students complete work as well. Outside of school, I enjoy music and video games. I play the bass guitar and plan to start a band with my friends, only lacking a drummer. I played cello in school orchestra from 4th to 10th grade, but I quit this year to finish classes necessary for graduation.

# Education
At Havre de Grace, I have taken many programming classes including those for Java and database SQL. I have a great interest in programming and computers, and have held that since middle school. In addition to ITOA classes, I have also taken challenging coursework in the form of AP classes, including AP Government, AP CSB, AP World, and I am currently taking AP CSA and AP Physics 1. My GPA is 4.1875 weighted and 3.5625 unweighted.
